# Wave3d

The repository contains grids (*UGX*) and script (*LUA*) files to initiate a calcium wave in neurons.

## Notes
When using LIMEX as the time stepping scheme and concurrently outputting VTK
data one needs to use an older version of the LIMEX plugin before running the
simulation by: `git checkout 1384a90d0d1f75f582563e71cdf4295f17bfd474`.
